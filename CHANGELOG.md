# Changelog

## 1.0.18

### New CLI Commands
- Added `doctor` command — checks project health (cubit registration, route wiring, import consistency, localization key parity across ARB files)
- Added `remove-feature` command — safely removes a feature and unwires its cubit, routes, and imports (inverse of `feature`)
- Added `add-locale` command — adds a new language/locale ARB file with TODO placeholders from the English reference

### Branding
- Updated README with Codeable branding (lime/purple badge strip, dynamic pub.dev version badge, wordmark footer with dark/light mode)
- Added Codeable wordmark SVG assets

### New Claude Plugin Skills (10 skill templates)
- `add-model` — Generate data models with fromJson/toJson/copyWith/Equatable
- `add-pagination` — Wire paginated API calls using PaginationModel in cubit state with PaginatedListView
- `add-form` — Generate validated form screens with CustomTextField, FieldValidators, and cubit submission
- `add-di` — Register services/repositories in GetIt dependency injection
- `add-hive-model` — Generate Hive TypeAdapter models with auto TypeId assignment
- `add-test` — Generate cubit and repository unit tests with mocktail and bloc_test

## 1.0.17

- Auto-install [Codeable Flutter CLI Claude Plugin](https://github.com/gocodeable/codeable-flutter-cli-claude-plugin) in generated projects via `.claude/settings.json`
- New projects get all commands, skills, agents, and hooks from the plugin automatically — no manual setup needed
- Removed inline `.claude/commands/` files (localize, fix-rtl, add-api, add-cubit-state) — the plugin now provides these and more

## 1.0.16

- Added `pageTransitionsTheme` to `ThemeData` with `FadeForwardsPageTransitionsBuilder` for smooth Android page transitions

## 1.0.15

- `feature` command no longer auto-prompts for role selection when multiple role directories exist
- Role selection is now opt-in: use `--role <name>` to specify a role directly, or `--pick-role` (`-R`) to interactively choose from existing role directories
- Without `--role` or `--pick-role`, features are created directly in `lib/features/`
- Added `Localization` static service (`lib/l10n/localization_service.dart`) for accessing localized strings without `BuildContext`
- `Localization.keyName` works anywhere (validators, formatters, models); `context.l10n.keyName` remains preferred in widgets
- `l10n.dart` barrel file now exports `localization_service.dart` so a single import gives access to both `context.l10n` and `Localization`
- `AppView` builder auto-updates the `Localization` service on every locale change
- Added `/localize` Claude Code slash command (`.claude/commands/localize.md`) that auto-localizes an entire feature directory
- Fixed all remaining `EdgeInsets.only(left/right)` and `EdgeInsets.fromLTRB` in templates to use `EdgeInsetsDirectional` for proper RTL support
- Added `/fix-rtl` Claude Code command to migrate `EdgeInsets` to `EdgeInsetsDirectional` in existing projects
- Added `/add-api` Claude Code command to wire up a new API endpoint end-to-end through all architecture layers
- Added `/add-cubit-state` Claude Code command to add new state fields and cubit methods to existing features
- Updated CLAUDE.md and .cursorrules templates with localization pattern documentation

## 1.0.13

- Updated all dependency versions to latest (Firebase 4.x, GoRouter 17.x, get_it 9.x, etc.)
- Fixed staging/development flavors using PascalCase instead of app display name
- Moved `update` command documentation near Installation in README

## 1.0.11

- README code blocks split for easier copying

## 1.0.8

- Flavor display names now use suffix format: `MyApp [DEV]`, `MyApp [STG]`

- Per-flavor app icons for iOS (AppIcon-dev, AppIcon-stg) and Android (development/staging source sets)
- Bundled BBBPoppins (headings) and SFProRounded (body) fonts with updated text styles
- Run configurations moved to `.idea/runConfigurations/` with `buildFlavor` option for Android Studio
- Fixed app crash from MainActivity namespace mismatch (`_relocateMainActivity`)
- Added `UIApplicationSceneManifest` and `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` to Info.plist
- Firebase packages kept active in pubspec (initialization remains commented out in DI)
- Centered app bar title by default, no leading image when back button is hidden

## 1.0.6

- Keystore now uses `<project_name>-keystore.jks` filename and `<project_name>-alias`

- Removed deprecated `legacyCustomAppBar` from templates
